Cast Keys is a basic text editor simulation for Google's Chromecast using the Cast API through a Chrome App.


DEMO
---------
You will not be able to see the receiver on your Chromecast since you need to enter your App ID and whitelist your device, but you can see an example of the sender at http://cast.nathanrjones.com/keys.
